# Keyboard Featherwing in Rust

This is a playground for working with @arturo182's Keyboard Featherwing in Rust using the [Adafruit Feather M4 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3857). It is ported from [@jamesmunns's original work](https://github.com/jamesmunns/keywing-rs) targeting the [Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062).
